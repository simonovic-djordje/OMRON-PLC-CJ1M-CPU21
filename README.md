# Project Declaration: Washing Machine

## Overview
When creating this project, we used the CJ1M - CPU 21 controller with SYSMAC - WAY network connection. Due to the very structure of the project, two modules for digital input (CJ1W - ID 211 (DC Input Unit)) with 16 inputs each were needed for production, allowing us to use a total of 32 inputs. A module (CJ1W – OC211 (Relay Output Unit)) with 16 outputs was used for output signals.

Nineteen inputs and twelve outputs were utilized in creating the project, also with the use of 18 auxiliary variables (flags).
