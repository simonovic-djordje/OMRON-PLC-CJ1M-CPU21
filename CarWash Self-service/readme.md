# Project Declaration: Self-service car wash

## Overview
This project was developed using the CJ1M - CPU 21 controller with SYSMAC - WAY network connection. For inputs, a Cj1W - ID211 (DC Input Unit) module with 16 digital inputs was utilized, and for digital outputs, another module (Cj1W - OC211 (Relay Output Unit)) with 16 digital outputs was employed. The project also included 12 inputs, 13 outputs, and 5 auxiliary variables (flags) for development. Additionally, a CJ1W - AD041 - V1 (Analog Input Unit 4 Points) was incorporated into the system.
